# Quantum Hedge Fund

![Quantum Oracles](/assets/Quantum%20Hedge%20Fund.001.jpeg)

## Overview
Quantum Hedge Fund is an on-chain hedge fund powered by Chainlink that implements advanced fund management strategies by using a quantum algorithm for portfolio diversification. This project features smart contracts for managing a cryptocurrency vault, integrating Chainlink oracles for accurate pricing and Quickswap for token exchanges.

## Features
- **Token Management**: Support for a diverse range of cryptocurrencies, enabling dynamic adjustments to the portfolio.
- **Vault Shares**: Tokenization of shares in the vault using `VaultShareToken`.
- **Deposits and Withdrawals**: Robust mechanisms for depositing and withdrawing funds.
- **Automated Rebalancing**: Portfolio rebalancing executed based on strategies defined in the `FundManager` contract.
- **Chainlink and Uniswap Integration**: Ensures reliable price feeds and efficient liquidity management.
- **Quantum portfolio diversification**: unique and advanced fund strategy based on a quantum algorithm

## Components

### Chainlink:
- Datafeed: calculating the total value of the pool 
- Functions: retrieving allocations from the quantum oracle
- Automation: initiating rebalancing of assets

### Smart Contracts:
1. **Vault Contract**: Manages core functions such as deposits, withdrawals, and rebalancing.
2. **FundManager Contract**: Oversees token weights and handles oracle requests for portfolio management.
3. **VaultShareToken Contract**: ERC20 token representing a stake in the vault.

### Quantum Computing API:
- Send asset prices to the API and choose algorithm to run (quantum or quantum-inspired)
- Runs quantum algorithm with asset prices
- Sends optimal selection of assets from quantum algorithm
- Draws diagram of quantum program and plots optimisation
- Deployed at URL

### User Interface:
- User can deposit funds
- User can withdraw funds
- Visual representation of the asset allocations

## Getting Started
Engaging with Quantum Hedge Fund requires familiarity with Solidity, Ethereum blockchain, and smart contract development.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm
- Hardhat

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Quantum-Hedge-Funds/smart-contracts.git
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile the smart contracts with Hardhat:
   ```sh
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

4. Deploy the contracts:
   ```sh
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network polygonMainnet
   ```

### Testing
Run the test suite to ensure everything functions as expected:
```sh
npx hardhat test
```

## Usage
Interact with the Quantum Hedge Fund contracts through the Hardhat console or by integrating them into a frontend application using Web3.js or Ethers.js.

## Security
This project is in the developmental phase. Thoroughly review the code before deploying it in production environments.
